description: The author of New Grub Street turns to farce in this 1898 novel, one
  of his most popular during his lifetime. Our hero, Gammon, tangles with his landlady
  Mrs. Bubb, the shady detective Greenacre, the bigamous Lord Polperro, and young
  Polly Sparkes, caught up in a rollicking chase about London on New Year's Eve.
